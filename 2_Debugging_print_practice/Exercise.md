## Exercise 2
### Debugging practice

Look at the code in the code editor. There are errors on all 5 lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors. Try to run the code and debug each line using the error messages and feedback.

***Current code***

 print("The print statement is used to output strings")

print("Strings are strings of characters"

priint("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
