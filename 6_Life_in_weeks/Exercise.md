## Exercise 6
### Life in weeks

Create a function called life_in_weeks() using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

*You have x weeks left.*

Where x is replaced with the actual calculated number of weeks the input age has left until age 90.
